## Groundwork

+ Go over Sagnick’s Miller summary
+ Larger project of novel and the police?
+ Questions about the theory? Ask now.
+ What is Lukacs saying. Ask Rachel to contextualize his work.

## Regulatory forces

+ Where are the police in Barchester Towers? What are the regulatory forces in the novel?
+ “Moderate schism,” and its relationship to Lukacs’ conception of the epic.
+ Do we buy Miller’s characterization of Barchester Towers’ form?
+ What is the disciplinary power in Last Chronicle?

## Structure of the novel

+ Nature of quotidian form
+ Function of biographical detail
+ The novel in the age of institutions.
+ The marriage plot

### Realism of characters

+ Barthes, Watt give us a lot on materialistic detail leading to formal realism. What about the realism of characters? How is this built, what kinds of details form a more ‘formally real’ character?
+ Why does Quiverfull feel like a caricature, while Crawley feels more fleshed out? 
+ Reference autobiography handout
+ [Idea?] Perhaps the ‘realism’ achieved in *Barchester Towers* is the realism of a community of acquaintances; we the reader feel part of a very real circle of gossip, while the type of realism that accompanies Crawley in *Last Chronicle* is more intimate.

## Value

+ What is the relationship between the invisible hand of classical economics and the narrator of a novel?
+ Entanglement of moral and economic value. Do we buy Poovey’s claim that the evaluative function in Last Chronicle, absent the invasion of a narrator, becomes crowdsourced and dispersed?
+ Theft by finding, and Crawley’s relationship to Trollope.

### Women

+ Context of women in Victorian Lit
+ What are the overlaps, significances in the parallels between Mrs. Quiverfull, Mrs. Crawley, and Mrs. Proudie?
+ Transition into Hali’s close reading
+ Look to Trollope’s parents [?]

## E Pluribus Unum: the Series as a Whole

+ Poovey

### Eleanor

+ Is there any significance in the parallels between Barchester and Barset, dramatic tension ultimately coming down on the shoulders of nobody asking Eleanor things?

+ What is the difference between a woman ‘taking control’ over her husbands proceedings, and a woman taking control over **her own money** after marriage? What’s the significance of Eleanor’s ignorance over the function of a cheque vs. cash?

### Endings

+ Last lines of both the autobiography and the novel

## To be discussed

+ reading load
+ Princeton on March 22
+ syllabus sign-ups for next week and beyond 
+ pitch workshop attendance discussion (ie, do we/does anyone want to drop in perhaps in lieu of break next week)
+ Mastodon instance
