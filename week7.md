# Outline, Week 7
#### Second half of _Villette_


## Readings

+ Charlotte Bronte, *Villette* (second half)
+ Sharon Marcus, *Between Women*, Introduction and Chapter 2
+ Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus, "Surface Reading: An Introduction"
+ William Cohen, "Why Is There So Much French in *Villette*?"

## Talking about the Readings

+ Selections from Sharon Marcus's *Between Women*
  + We have **two** summaries from Laura and Sagnik to work with!
  + In what ways are Marcus's frameworks useful, especially in context or dialogue with others we've encountered earlier this semester? 
  + Laura and Sagnik are both skeptical! Perhaps we should mark these discontents and then  (re)visit the respective passages later on?

+ Surface Reading!
  + "A surface is what insists on being looked *at* rather than what we must train ourselves to see *through.*" (9)
  + Keton can I call on you to briefly run through the Best and Marcus?
  + "Just reading" and potentially going through what the different surfaces are
  + What are the larger implications of this kind of approach? Thoughts?
    + "In closing, we want to underscore two points: that to see more clearly does not require that we plumb hidden depths and that producing accurate accounts of surfaces is not antithetical to critique; indeed, it may be, as Bruno Latour has recently suggested, the best way to move past the impasses created by what has become an excessive emphasis on ideological demystification." (18)

## As a Segway into _Villette_

#### Representations, Narration, Interiority, Things we've been grappling with...

+ Keton does some fun things with Beck and Marcus, Cohn, and Cohen 
+ What do we think of French in _Villette_ and of Cohen's argument about French in _Villette_? In relation to Boone's argument about Miller from last week?

#### Passages and Questions to Consider

+ Lucy's relationships with Ginevra and Polly! 
    + "rivalry" and "amity"
+ Desire and sexuality: Boone's argument about Dr. John vs the M. Paul? Marcus's reading?
    + Marriage plot in _Villette_?    
+ The experience of reading the scene where Lucy wanders into the park? The celebration of independence as a backdrop to this?
+ M. Paul gives Lucy a house and a new set of friends (M. Milet), she inhabits new spaces?
+ Sagnik is interested in revisiting the play scene
+ Laura is interested in talking about the additional narrative detail we were given about Miss Marchmont and (I'm assuming) the hundred pounds Lucy receives at the end as a plot tie to the 'frame story'
+ Looking at all the characters who Lucy is set against:
    + Ginevra on the stage
    + Polly both in childhood and in adulthood (and likewise her marriage with Dr. John as contrasting to Lucy's own marriage(!?) with M. Paul
    + Madame Beck as romantic rival
    + Miss Marchmont as foreshadowing Lucy's own fate?
    + Madame Walravens as this incredible caricature and odd character?
+ the NUN. Is this parody? Real effect? A moment of real resistance? Are we guilty of symptomatic reading?
