English 111: Victorian Literature

Professor Rachel Buurma

## Overview

### Readings

*This week, we will read the two early long short stories that were the first pieces in the Chronicles of Carlingford. We will also read all of Oliphant's biography and her (unsigned) article on sensation novels (and note what else is in that issue of Blackwood's). They are jointed by two quantitative approach articles - Canon/Archive, carried over from last week, will help us think about the questions of canon and archive that always haunt any course on Victorian novels, and the one on social networks will help us think more concretely about how one might try to reduce and abstract Trollope's or Oliphant's Chronicles to a network of characters in order to aid our interpretation of the series form.* - Rachel

## Computational Works

*"A few words may imply a great deal in a little company, where all the interlocutors know all about each other"* (The Executor, 597).

### Social Networks

+ Traditional claim no. 1: "There is an inverse correlation between the amount of dialogue in a nineteenth century novel and the number of characters in that novel." --> Myth, busted.

+ Traditional claim no. 2: "A novel’s setting (urban or rural) [has] an effect on the structure of its social network." --> Myth, busted. Only correlation found? Type of narration (first person, etc.) and structure of network.

+ Computation questions? Let's talk about them.

### Cannon/Archive Lit Pamphlet 11

#### Definitions

+ Published: All the works which have been published
+ Archive: All the works which have been materially stored
+ Corpus: "The corpus, finally, is that portion of the archive that is selected, for one reason or another, in order to pursue a specific research project."
+ Polyphony:
+ Heteroglossia:

#### Motivations

*Dowry and vegetables: perfect antithesis. Both are important, but for opposite reasons: dowry, because it happens once in a lifetime; vegetables, because we eat them every day ... Intuitively, one would associate Waverley with the prestige of the dowry, and Sir Ferdinand with the humble role of chicory ... Scott’s novel was both a great formal breakthrough, and the book everybody was reading all over Europe: dowry and vegetables, rolled into one. But if that is the case, what difference can all the Sir Ferdinands of the digital archive make?* (Cannon/Archive Pamphlet 11, 3).

+ Ask Rachel to speak to the motivations behind this text. Who are these scholars, what drives them, why all the numbers?

#### Takeaways

+ Popularity vs. Prestige?
+ Redundancy
+ Lexical variety

#### Methods

+ Computation questions? Let's talk about them.

## Characterization and Narration

+ A question to return to: What is the relationsip between anxiety and interiority?

### Cohn

+ Hali's summary
+ Handout

### The Rector

+ Sagnik close reading
+ "I have learned to take perhaps more a man's view of mortal affairs,&mdash;to feel that the love between men and women, the marrying and giving in marriage, occupy in fact so small a portion of either existence or thought" (An Autobiography, 43-44)

### Transparent Minds? MOWO Autobiography vs Lucilla

+ "Anthony Trollope's talk about the characters in his books astonished me beyond measure, and I am totally incapable of talking about anything I have ever done in that way" (An Autobiography, 48).
+ Discussion from Sunday's class about how Lucilla does not seem to know her own mind.
+ Relationship between art and life? "The human story in all its chapters" (An Autobiography, 177).

### The Executor

+ Omnicience
+ Nancy taking tea (602)
+ The detective plot and D.A. Miller
  + Sensation Novels review

## Inheritance

What is the relationship between authorship and a last will and testament?

+ The Executor
  + Absent daughter
  + Nancy

+ An Autobiography
  + "I wonder if I will ever have time to put a few autobiographical bits down before I die. I am in very little danger of having my life written."
  + "I have been reading the life of Mr Symonds, and it makes me almost laugh (though little laughing is in my heart) to think of the strange difference between this prosaic little narrative, all about the facts of a life so simple as mine, and his elaborate self-discussions" (An Autobiography, 144).
  + "I pay the penalty in that I shall not leave anything behind me that will live" (An Autobiography, 183).

+ Miss Marjoribanks
  + Lucilla inherits nothing

## Space/Time

+ The novel as quotidian
  + "Alas—is it not yesterday? Life is full of dreadful repetitions" (An Autobiography, 69)
+ Laura's "close" reading of MOWO's space
+ The executor's home
