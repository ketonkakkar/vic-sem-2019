# Outline, Week 4
*2.17.2019*

**Some Topics:** serials and series (*what happens when we try to imagine all six Barsetshire novels or the Carlingford novels as part of a single world?*); roman fleuve; marriage; travel; Trollope and/vs Oliphant; comparison; gender and character; *carrying over from week 2 especially* series and seriality; status and class; precarity

**Reading**

+ Miss Marjoribanks (1865-6), second half
+ Lauren Goodlad, "Bigger Love"
+ Lit Lab Canon/Archive pamphlet
+ Eric Hayot, from *On Literary Worlds*
+ Pheng Cheah, "What Is a World? On World Literature as World-Making Activity"

### The Critical Readings

+ Talk about the Goodlad
  + [Keton's Summary]
  + Perhaps, clarifications on the Arrighi formulation of *long centuries* that lies at the heart of all of this
    + My questions:
      + What is the graph saying, generally?
      + What were the economic conditions of "*CM' 19*" and "*CM' 20*" that make them comparable in the first place?
  + Picking up Keton's question (*which I strongly second*) of whether all of this is as tightly constructed as it seems
    + /or are we just missing context / explanation?


+ Talk about the Hayot and Cheah
  + Make sure we have all of the threads in Cheah ironed out and understood (*I don't*)
  + What precisely is the *structure of opening*
  + **Why this week?**
    + [open into discussion of *Miss. Marjoribanks*]

## The Insular World of Carlingford

+ Sagnik has pointed out that *Miss. Marjoribanks* seems to be operating not unlike the *noir* world, or a *microcosm*
  + What do we make of that?
  + Are there other models that we can imagine the '*world*' of Carlingford as?
  + (Insularity as something other than *type* of world (*noir*) or true *microcosm* (is Carlingford a metonymic to *Society*, or is it more idyosyncratic; if so, what do we make of that?)

### Transitioning from Insularity to Opening: Repetitive speech

+ Repetitive speech clips (what Keton calls *catch phrases*) seem to be really important.
  + [Keton's close reading]
    + Connect to Sagnik's paper as well
      + Barbara's "narrative rupture" (Keton) and Woodburn's "denaturing the world" through mimicry (Sagnik, quoting Cheah)
  + **Note:** Trollope's use of a *catch phrase* in *Doctor Thorne* is explored a bit in the Goodlad (718) -- may be useful?

+ Repetitive speech as a site for *world opening,* but also...
  + In what ways does repetitive speech actually turn our world *in* on itself?
  + What are the *differences* in Barbara's annoyance and Woodburn's mimicry?
  + How do these function *together with* and *against* the actual repetitive speech of the characters?
  + What function does the narrative picking up on these phrases have?

+ [*possible tangent; not sure where best to discuss this*]
  + Mimicry vs. Satire (*Spectator review*) in relation to repetitive speech
  + (or in relation to *instinct* vs. *genius*?)

## The Structure of Opening in *Miss. Marjoribanks*

+ Continuing from the discussion of repetitive speech, where is the _opening mechanism_ in _Miss Marjoribanks_
  + How does *this insular world* relate to the outer world?
  + How is the insularity broken out of?

+ Narrative insularity as relates to local insularity
  + Reading *how the novel subtly deals with larger issues women face* through *world opening* framework
  + [ie My (Laura's) close reading from Week 3, pulled into this discussion]
  + also worth looking at: pg. 247
    + Narrative style almost breaks into '*gothic*' (/at least v. ghostly) when describing Mrs. Mortimer
    + (_Not to mention... **Mortimer** is almost as pointed a name as **Proudie**_)
    + What is this doing?
  + Also: Mrs. Woodburn, abuse, being *trapped* in a marriage
    + (discuss language around Mrs. Woodburn during the Cavendish/Archdeacon tension)
    + *Use that to transition into*
  + **Possible home for autobiographical tangent?**
+ The Cavendishes as agents of opening
  + [Sagnik's paper]

## Serials and Worldbuilding
+ Back to Goodlad
+ Both Trollope and Oliphant; how does *serial* create a *world*
+ Thinking about *Miss. Marjoribanks* as serial:
  + How do the three volumes (taken as distinct parts of one work) create insularity
  + But also, how do they progressively open up the world?
  + Work off Hali's readings of *time* in Miss. Marjoribanks
    + Frankly, I am still having trouble conceptualizing the Goodlad enough to apply it, but Hali's paper does this well.

## Miscellaneous
+ Not sure where to work in the *Autobiography,* as it seems relevant, but tangential, to really every point we're making.
