+ David Kurnick, "An Erotics of Detachment: *Middlemarch* and Novel-Reading as Critical Practice"

## Talking about Critical Readings

+ Talking about David Kurnick's "An Erotics of Detachment," whom all three of our writers this week have engaged with: thoughts? questions? doubts?
  + thinking about the novel as "critical discourse" and the implications this has for narrator and character relationships, reading practices, etc.
  + Clarification for me: what is "novelistic desire" though? The aspiration for the epic?  Detachment and objective or multiplicity? I do think that Kurnick is wielding this term on several different levels; and of course, some other obvious questions, is this desire in *Middlemarch* gendered in a way that the example of Frederic Moreau is not? 
  + Keton's criticism summary!
  + Sagnik's seminar paper?
  + Laura's seminar paper?

+ Leah Price's "George Eliot and the Production of Consumers"
  + Eliot and Narration
  + Novel vs. Anthology (vs. Poetry)
  + Her epigraphs to each chapter?
  + Review and self-review or self-consciousness of review?
  
+ *Middlemarch* and its "social-scientific seriousness"
+ What about Rosamund, Tertius Lydgate, and Fred Vincy and his uncles, and the entire other world of Middlemarch?
  + Lydgate's European backstory...
+ Other passages we want to visit?
