# Outline (Week 9)

**Charles Reade, *Hard Cash***

Since this discussion will be taking place in a car and not for very long, I'm thinking it will be best if we try to ground it in the work that everybody did for this week. Rachel, if you want to take some time near the end to tell us anything field-trip related, we can take that into account as well.

## Novels, Process, and Realism

+ Keton's seminar paper, anything that you want to say?
  + There's some reference to Barthes here. Rachel, can you briefly contextualize this reading? 
  + What are our thoughts on Barthes; shift away from his post-structuralist skepticism about the very possibility of reference? 

+ This seems like a good time to talk about realism and Reade. Haines compares Reade's realistic method to English empirical thought, and later to Zola's own realistic method. 
  + Possible sidenote: I am reminded at least a little of the Latour from a while ago, and we didn't really talk about it then. If I remember correctly, the notion of science presenting a copy of the world breaks down in that reading. Is this at odds with the English empirical thought that Reade bases his realism on?

+ It seems like everybody who has something to say about realism thinks that they are 'correct'. How *do* we determine literary value? 
+ Hali's criticism summary and Poovey
  + Can we try to answer Hali's questions? They are interesting, but I'm not sure what to make of them.
  + On 449, Poovey mentions an 'alternative literary field' that might have accommodated Reades novels as well as a mode of criticism that could have valued them. Rachel, is there anything more you could say about such criticism? 

+ Can't really think of a great segue, but my close reading (if we can call it that)! I guess the motivating question of my reading is where the notebook lies in relation to the novel. Reader makes an argument for treating notebooks as primary texts. While that's all well and good, I wonder what happens if we try to look at both notebook and novel simultaneously. Are we already doing that in reading the novel? Is this a pointless or nonsensical endeavor?

## Hard Cash

+ Other textual forms creep into the novel. Prescriptions, diary entries, letters, laws (I think). What do we make of this? 
+ 364: But they proceeded to examine the three books an asylum has to keep by law: the visitor's book, the case book, and the medical journal. Why are these books credible even though the asylum people were just shown to be dishonest?

+ Anything about the novel people want to talk about?

+ What notes interested people the most?
