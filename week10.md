# Outline (Week 10)

### Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, *Rajmohan's Wife*

## The Sensation Novel

+ Hali?
+ "a laterally inclined sense of the Victorian, apart from delinking it from the circumscription of national-racial boundary lines..., helps us better to understand the structures of power and institutional authority as they insinuated themselves through those linked categories" (478)
  + Banerjee discusses the lateral sense of the Victorian in the context of Indian literature. Do we have anything to say about British literature through this lens? 
+ What do we make of the "language of excess" as compensation for a need for loyalty?
+ Sensation novels as morality stories
  + Drawing on Joshi, I am struck by the argument that "the radical themes in Reynolds's novels putatively resonated further with the movement for internal social reform that had been sweeping India" (82). 

## Other criticism readings

+ Chaudhuri
  + Jameson and "third-world texts"? I am just really perplexed as to why anyone would say that. 
  + "The woman protagonist in *RW* signals a dangerous exess that domesticity cannot absorb" (43). 
    + Again with the excess, except here, there's the foil that the excess is intolerable. 
  + The male task of constituting the female subject
    + Do we see this in the other novels? I'm trying to invoke the lateral Victorian here.
  + Colonial Uncanny
    + I'm unsure as to the definition of uncanny here (Rachel?)
  + Chaudhuri's tracing of Mathur's house reminds me of Jameson's floor-plan. 
  + What is *habitus*?
  
## Print

+ Joshi
  + Laura?
  + At the time of writing this, I'm still going through the reading.
  + Do we agree with the definition of melodrama on 85? RW seems pretty melodramatic, but I wouldn't say that Matangini is free from internal conflict.
    + Does melodrama in RW give shape to the "enemy"?

## Realism

+ Seminar Paper
+ I think I'm still iffy on semiotics and reference, but it seems like Mohanty is making a statement about literary realism that isn't contradictory, but also very different from Barthes's. How right/wrong am I?
+ What do we think about Mohanty's argument?
+ **My questions:** 
  + When we discuss realism, are we trying to get at the "right" one?
  + If so, once we get it... what then?
  + How culturally bound is realism?

## Other things about RW

+ Question about the criticism: All of the writing we read for this week presented some form of historicizing. Is there something about reading colonial texts that demands historicizing?
+ World literature?
+ Who is the protagonist? Is there one? Several?
+ Why is the ending so strange? It could be that Bankim rushed to finish it, but I want to pick it apart a bit more.
+ I am particularly interested in what I call the "untranslatables". What kind of work does that do?
